# ML-Music-Analyzer
This repository uses ML to determine real-time chords, bpm, and extract other features from music

You can train the model from scratch, using `train_v2.py` - or use the pre-trained model (`trained_music_model.hdf5`) found in this repository.

To run the program, simply execute `test.py` - and change the input parameters at the top!
